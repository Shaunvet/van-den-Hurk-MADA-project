	abstract = {Background:
              The American Heart Association, in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, annually reports on the most up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular risk factors, including core health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, diet, and weight) and health factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose control) that contribute to cardiovascular health. The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs).
            
            
              Methods:
              The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2020 Statistical Update is the product of a full year’s worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year’s edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, metrics to assess and monitor healthy diets, an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, a focus on the global burden of cardiovascular disease, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors, implementation strategies, and implications of the American Heart Association’s 2020 Impact Goals.
            
            
              Results:
              Each of the 26 chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, healthcare administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.},

	abstract = {Background
Amid stagnating declines in national cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, documenting trends in county‐level hypertension‐related CVD death rates can help activate local efforts prioritizing hypertension prevention, detection, and control.

Methods and Results
Using death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System, Bayesian spatiotemporal models were used to estimate county‐level hypertension‐related CVD death rates and corresponding trends during 2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2019 for adults aged ≥35 years overall and by age group, race or ethnicity, and sex. Among adults aged 35 to 64 years, county‐level hypertension‐related CVD death rates increased from a median of 23.2 per 100 000 in 2000 to 43.4 per 100 000 in 2019. Among adults aged ≥65 years, county‐level hypertension‐related CVD death rates increased from a median of 362.1 per 100 000 in 2000 to 430.1 per 100 000 in 2019. Increases were larger and more prevalent among adults aged 35 to 64 years than those aged ≥65 years. More than 75\% of counties experienced increasing hypertension‐related CVD death rates among patients aged 35 to 64 years during 2000 to 2010 and 2010 to 2019 (76.2\% [95\% credible interval, 74.7–78.4] and 86.2\% [95\% credible interval, 84.6–87.6], respectively), compared with 48.2\% (95\% credible interval, 47.0–49.7) during 2000 to 2010 and 66.1\% (95\% credible interval, 64.9–67.1) for patients aged ≥65 years. The highest rates for both age groups were among men and Black populations. All racial and ethnic categories in both age groups experienced widespread county‐level increases.

Conclusions
Large, widespread county‐level increases in hypertension‐related CVD mortality sound an alarm for intensified clinical and public health actions to improve hypertension prevention, detection, and control and prevent subsequent CVD deaths in counties across the nation.},

Blood pressure levels have consistently been higher for African Americans with an earlier onset of hypertension.

The higher blood pressure levels for African Americans are associated with higher rates of stroke, end-stage renal disease and congestive heart failure. The reasons for the racial disparities in elevated blood pressure and hypertension-related outcomes risk remain unclear. However, the implications of the disparities of hypertension for prevention and clinical management are substantial, identifying African American men and women with excel hypertension risk and warranting interventions focused on these differences. In addition, focused research to identify the factors attributed to these disparities in risk burden is an essential need to address the evidence gaps.},

	abstract = {Overall hypertension prevalence has not changed in the United States in recent decades although awareness, treatment, and control improved. However, hypertension epidemiology and its temporal trends may differ in younger adults compared with older adults. Our study included 41 331 participants ≥18 years of age from 8 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999-2014) and estimated temporal trends of hypertension, awareness, treatment, and control among young adults (age, 18-39 years) compared with middle-age (age, 40-59 years) and older adults (age, ≥60 years). In 2013 to 2014, 7.3\% of the US young adults had hypertension. During 1999 to 2014, young adults saw larger increases in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control than did older adults. However, all of these components of hypertension control were lower among young adults compared with middle-aged or older adults (74.7\% younger versus 81.9\% middle versus 88.4\% older for awareness; 50.0\% versus 70.3\% versus 83.0\% for treatment; and 40.2\% versus 56.7\% versus 54.4\% for control). Worse hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in young adults overall were mostly driven by worse measures in young adult men compared with young adult women. More frequent healthcare visits by young adult women explained ≈28\% of the sex-related difference in awareness, 60\% of the difference in treatment, and 52\% of the difference in control. These findings suggest that improved access to and engagement in medical care might improve hypertension control in young adults, particularly young adult men, and reduce life-time cardiovascular risk.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality increased during the initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic, but whether these trends endured in 2022 is unknown. This analysis describes temporal trends in CVD death rates from 2010 to 2022 and estimates excess CVD deaths from 2020 to 2022.
METHODS: Using national mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System, deaths among adults aged ≥35 years were classified by underlying cause of death International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision codes for CVD (I00-I99), heart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, I20-I51), and stroke (I60-I69). Analyses in Joinpoint software identified trends in CVD age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100,000 and estimated the number of excess CVD deaths from 2020 to 2022.
RESULTS: During 2010-2022, 10,951,403 CVD deaths occurred (75.6\% heart disease, 16.9\% stroke). The national CVD AAMR declined by 8.9\% from 2010 to 2019 (456.6-416.0 per 100,000) and then increased by 9.3\% from 2019 to 2022 to 454.5 per 100,000, which approximated the 2010 rate (456.7 per 100,000). From 2020 to 2022, 228,524 excess CVD deaths occurred, which was 9\% more CVD deaths than expected based on trends from 2010 to 2019. Results varied by CVD subtype and population subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite stabilization of the public health emergency, declines in CVD mortality rates reversed in 2020 and remained high in 2022, representing almost a decade of lost progress and over 228,000 excess CVD deaths. Findings underscore the importance of prioritizing prevention and management of CVD to improve outcomes.},
