#raw-data
The raw data in this file is the RDS file that was produced after initial cleaning steps. This was due to size constraints with the original Excel sheet and uploads on GitHub. 

To get the original Excel sheet you may contact me directly. Shaun.vandenhurk@uga.edu.

Alternatively, follow the link or review the reference from the manuscript to the CDC website (https://data.cdc.gov/Heart-Disease-Stroke-Prevention/Rates-and-Trends-in-Hypertension-related-Cardiovas/uc9k-vc2j/about_data). Be aware of your file name if attempting to integrate into the workflow.


This RDS document is used for the second stage of cleaning which was done in the processingfile-v1.qmd file.
