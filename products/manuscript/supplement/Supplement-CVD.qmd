knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "tables", "mortality_summary_by_race.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "figures", "combined_spatial_plot.png"))
cat("**Supplementary Figure S3.** Spatial distribution of hypertension-related mortality – Combined plot of all race/ethnicity groups.\n\n")

```


The combined plot (Supplement Figure 3) provides an overview of mortality patterns across groups. While harder to read at the small scale once rendered in Word, it was still included as it offers helpful visual context when reviewed alongside the full-size individual maps.

The map identifies county-level clusters of high or low mortality rates relative to their neighbors. Statistically significant clusters include high–high (mortality hotspots), low–low (coldspots), and spatial outliers (high–low or low–high), with color coding based on the spatial relationship and statistical significance.\n\n")

This map visualizes statistically significant local spatial autocorrelation in hypertension-related mortality rates across counties in Georgia. High–high clusters indicate counties with high mortality rates surrounded by similarly high neighbors, while low–low clusters represent the opposite.

```

Cross-validation performance metrics for Random Forest model. Mean RMSE and R² values are shown across 10-fold cross-validation for selected hyperparameter combinations (mtry and min_n). Values reflect consistent predictive performance across folds, indicating high model stability.

cat("**Supplementary Table S4.** Ten-fold cross-validation performance metrics for the LASSO regression model. Values represent mean RMSE and R² with 95% confidence intervals based on variability across folds using the selected penalty parameter.\n\n")
```

Cross-validation performance metrics for LASSO regression model. Mean RMSE and R² values with 95% confidence intervals are reported across 10-fold cross-validation folds using the optimal penalty value. The narrow confidence intervals reflect low variability and high consistency in model performance.

## Reproducibility and Software

### Steps for reproducing the project

To fully reproduce all steps of the project, the code should be run in the following order:

1. processing-code/processing-code.qmd 
2. eda-code/eda.qmd
3. analysis-code/statistical-analysis-v2-slim.qmd* 
4. products/manuscript/Manuscript.qmd
5. products/manuscript/supplement/Supplement-CVD.qmd 

*Note: This is a large script and will take some time and processing power to run. The script uses loops to load saved data to reduce computation but expect it to take about 15 minutes to run the full script even with those steps.

Note: Because all data, figures, and tables are saved in the relevant subfolders, the manuscript 
can be produced by simply running the Manuscript.qmd file.

Note: processing-code/processing-code.qmd - This file will not run as the Excel CSV file is not in the repository due to size limitations. It was included purely to demonstrate processing steps. You can contact the author to get it or download the file directly from the CDC website if you wish to run this yourself.
