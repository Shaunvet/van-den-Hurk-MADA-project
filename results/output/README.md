# output

Folder for output files from models or other analyses. 
These are intermediate objects and need to be further processed into figures or tables for presentation, but are also saved to speed up many processes by loading saved data, and also as a backup in case a certain element does not function. 

There are three main subfolders which containing a lot of the materials from each sections of the analysis (eda, processing and statistical analysis).

Currently the file is a little disorganized because there are a lot of additional files from the modelling steps (from statistical analysis) present in the folder. 
This was intentional to reduce the number of subfolder pathways and to keep most of the modelling files in an easy to find place (and make it easier to observe file sizes). However, this could be restructured if desired. by adding more subfolders.
