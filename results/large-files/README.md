# large-files

This file stores the results of computations that produce large files (RF and LASSO model tuning). 

Folder for any large files that are too big to be tracked with GitHub.
That's generally anything above around 20MB. 

This folder is set in `.gitignore` to be ignored when pushing/pulling. (The folder itself and the readme will be synced, but all other files will be ignored.)

This folder will not be visible in the GitHub repository and so requests must be made for this material.

Instructions for obtaining large files: email shaun.vandenhurk@uga.du
